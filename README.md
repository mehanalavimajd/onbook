> Read online books for free, Write online books for free!

onbook is an online platform to share your books for free. The name stands for **Online Books, Okay?!**

On onbook, you can read books as much as you want, and write your own books!

> Note that onbook is not a microblogging service. Each book has its own description, content, rating, word count, chapters, etc.

onbook uses CKEditor for writing page and it has a built-in engine to generate beautiful styles!

Can you imagine that, you can generate a reliable style for each book you create?
